# dummy-server

Test to see if I can make a server that:

- [x] logs to STDOUT
- [x] uses `pack` for dependencies
- [ ] publishes a docker image
- [x] makes requests to other services before responding to requests
- [x] calls some node function provided by an external library
- [x] connects to a DB
- [ ] logs errors usefully
- [ ] parse nested routes
- [x] accept JSON
- [x] parse JSON and insert something in DB
- [x] respond with JSON for a value looked up in the DB
- [ ] single page web app...
- [ ] ... that makes api calls to the backend
