# dummy-server

Test to see if I can make a server that:

- [x] logs to STDOUT
- [x] uses `pack` for dependencies
- [ ] publishes a docker image
- [ ] makes requests to other services before responding to requests
- [ ] calls some node function provided by an external library
- [ ] connects to a DB
